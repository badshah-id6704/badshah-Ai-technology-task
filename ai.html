    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. These machines can learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as decision-making, language understanding, and problem-solving.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
    <p>
      AI is used in various fields including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. In healthcare, AI helps in diagnosing diseases, recommending treatments, and managing patient data. In finance, AI algorithms detect fraudulent transactions and predict stock market trends. Self-driving cars, voice assistants, and recommendation systems in platforms like Netflix and Amazon are also popular examples of AI.
    </p>

    <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
    <p>
      The future of AI holds immense potential. With advancements in machine learning and data processing, AI systems are expected to become more efficient and intelligent. However, ethical concerns regarding job displacement, data privacy, and decision-making transparency need to be carefully addressed.
